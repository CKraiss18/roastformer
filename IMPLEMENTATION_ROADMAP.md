# 🚀 ROASTFORMER IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
## Aligned with Your Proposal Timeline

---

## 📅 **UPDATED TIMELINE**

### **Your Original Proposal:**
- Oct 27-Nov 1: Generate 10K synthetic profiles ❌ (Changed to real data!)
- Nov 3-8: Implement DTransformer with 3 positional encoding variants ✅
- Nov 10-15: Run ablations, analyze attention, create visualizations ✅
- Nov 17-20: Finalize presentation, Model Card, pseudocode ✅

### **Adjusted for Real Data:**
- **Oct 28-Nov 3**: ✅ Collect real Onyx profiles (28 so far, growing!)
- **Nov 3-8**: Implement transformer + start training on current data
- **Nov 10-15**: Retrain with full dataset + ablations + attention analysis
- **Nov 17-20**: Finalize presentation + Model Card + pseudocode

---

## 🎯 **WEEK 1: NOV 3-8 (Implement & Debug)**

### **Day 1-2: Data Pipeline + Baseline Model (Nov 3-4)**

**TODAY (Nov 3):**
```bash
# Step 1: Prepare data
python 01_data_preparation.py

# Output:
# - preprocessed_data/training_data.pt
# - preprocessed_data/dataset_stats.json
# - Train: ~22 profiles, Val: ~6 profiles
```

**Tomorrow (Nov 4):**
```bash
# Step 2: Implement baseline transformer
python 02_baseline_model.py

# - Decoder-only architecture
# - Sinusoidal positional encoding (simplest)
# - Small model (d_model=128, 4 layers)
# - Fast to train, good for debugging
```

---

### **Day 3-4: Training Loop + First Results (Nov 5-6)**

```bash
# Step 3: Train baseline
python 03_train_baseline.py

# Expected with 22 training samples:
# - Epoch 1: Train Loss ~200, Val Loss ~300
# - Epoch 50: Train Loss ~5, Val Loss ~150 (OVERFITTING!)
# - This is NORMAL with small dataset
```

**What you'll learn:**
- ✅ Pipeline works end-to-end
- ✅ Model can fit training data (sanity check)
- ✅ Identifies bugs early
- ⚠️ High validation loss (expected - not enough data)

---

### **Day 5: Positional Encoding Variants (Nov 7)**

```bash
# Step 4: Implement 3 variants
python 04_positional_encodings.py

# Test on current data:
# 1. Sinusoidal (baseline)
# 2. Learned embeddings
# 3. RoPE (your paper presentation!)
```

**Goal:** Get infrastructure ready, results will improve with more data.

---

### **Day 6: Quick Visualizations (Nov 8)**

```bash
# Step 5: Generate & visualize
python 05_generate_profiles.py

# Create plots:
# - Generated vs. Real comparison
# - Attention heatmaps
# - Loss curves
# - Feature importance
```

---

## 🎯 **WEEK 2: NOV 10-15 (Retrain & Ablate)**

### **Day 7-8: Collect More Data & Retrain (Nov 10-11)**

```bash
# Step 6: Re-scrape Onyx
python onyx_dataset_builder_v3.1_ADDITIVE_FINAL.py

# Expected: 10-20 new profiles (if batches changed)
# Total: 40-50 profiles

# Step 7: Rerun data preparation
python 01_data_preparation.py --dataset onyx_dataset_2024_11_10

# New split: ~35 train, ~10 val (MUCH BETTER!)

# Step 8: Retrain baseline
python 03_train_baseline.py --dataset preprocessed_data_nov10

# Expected improvement:
# - Epoch 100: Train Loss ~8, Val Loss ~15 (much better!)
# - MAE ~5-8°F (approaching target)
```

---

### **Day 9-10: Ablation Studies (Nov 12-13)**

```bash
# Step 9: Run ablations
python 06_ablation_studies.py

# Test:
# 1. Positional encoding (Sinusoidal vs. Learned vs. RoPE)
# 2. Model size (Small vs. Medium)
# 3. Conditioning features (Phase 1 only vs. Phase 1+2 vs. Full)
# 4. With/without flavor conditioning

# Generate comparison table for presentation
```

---

### **Day 11-12: Attention Analysis (Nov 14-15)**

```bash
# Step 10: Analyze attention patterns
python 07_attention_analysis.py

# Questions to answer (from your proposal):
# - Do heads specialize on roasting phases?
# - Does attention focus on turning point?
# - Can we interpret what model learned?

# Create visualizations for presentation
```

---

## 🎯 **WEEK 3: NOV 17-20 (Finalize)**

### **Day 13-14: Model Card + Pseudocode (Nov 17-18)**

```bash
# Step 11: Create Model Card
python 08_create_model_card.py

# Include:
# - Architecture details
# - Training data characteristics
# - Performance metrics
# - Limitations and biases
# - Intended use
```

**Pseudocode (from Formal Algorithms):**
- DTransformer forward pass
- Auto-regressive generation
- Conditioning module
- Positional encoding variants

---

### **Day 15-16: Presentation (Nov 19-20)**

**Slides to prepare:**
1. Problem Statement
2. Dataset (real Onyx data > synthetic!)
3. Model Architecture
4. Training Results
5. Ablation Studies
6. Attention Analysis

## 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS (From Your Proposal)**

| Metric | Target | Week 1 (28 profiles) | Week 2 (50 profiles) |
|--------|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| MAE | <5°F | ~15-20°F (overfit) | ~5-8°F ✅ |
| Monotonicity | 100% | ~95% | ~100% ✅ |
| Bounded Rates | >95% | ~90% | >95% ✅ |
| Reach Targets | >90% | ~80% | >90% ✅ |

**Physical Plausibility:**
- Dense beans generate 20-25% slower heating
- Heating rates 20-100°F/min
- Smooth transitions (no jumps)

---

## 💡 **KEY DECISIONS**

### **Decision 1: Start Training NOW**
**Reasoning:**
- Get pipeline working early
- Debug with small data is easier
- Can retrain in a week with more data
- Shows steady progress

**Trade-off:**
- Week 1 results will overfit
- But that's OK - proves infrastructure works

---

### **Decision 2: Small Model First**
**Architecture for Week 1:**
```python
d_model = 128
nhead = 4
num_layers = 4
params = ~2M
```

**Week 2:** Scale up to medium (256/8/6, ~10M params)

**Reasoning:**
- Small model trains fast (good for debugging)
- Less prone to overfitting on 22 samples
- Can scale up when we have 50 profiles

---

### **Decision 3: Prioritize Real Data Over Synthetic**
**Your proposal mentioned 10K synthetic profiles.**

**Better approach:**
- Real data > Synthetic data
- 50 real profiles > 10K synthetic
- Onyx data has real flavor relationships

**If needed:** Can add synthetic data for data augmentation (slight temperature perturbations)

---

## 🚨 **RISKS & MITIGATION**

### **Risk 1: Not Enough Data (Week 1)**
**Mitigation:**
- Use heavy regularization (dropout=0.3)
- Small model to reduce overfitting
- Data augmentation (temperature noise ±2°F)
- Accept that Week 1 is proof-of-concept

### **Risk 2: Onyx Doesn't Update Batches**
**Mitigation:**
- Your 28 profiles may be enough (borderline)
- Can use data augmentation
- Synthetic data as last resort
- Focus on ablations over final accuracy

### **Risk 3: Timeline Compression**
**Mitigation:**
- Start Week 1 work TODAY
- Pipeline first, fancy features later
- Get baseline working, then iterate
